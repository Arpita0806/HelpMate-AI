    "## <code>Introduction:</code>\n",
    "In the insurance industry, policy documents contain crucial information regarding coverage, claims, exclusions, and benefits. However, these documents are often lengthy and complex, making it difficult for users to extract specific information efficiently. **Mr.HelpMate AI** aims to solve this problem by building a generative search system that effectively retrieves and generates answers from an insurance policy document using **retrieval augmented generation (RAG)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will focus on developing a structured **three-layer AI pipeline**, which includes an **embedding layer**, a **search layer**, and a **generation layer**, ensuring accurate, context-aware responses to user queries."

    "## <code>Approach & Steps:</code> \n",
    "The project is structured into three key layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **_`Embedding Layer`_**\n",
    "The embedding layer is responsible for processing, cleaning, and chunking the policy document into meaningful text segments. The goal is to store these chunks in a vector database for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Preprocess the PDF document**: Extract text, clean unnecessary formatting, and remove redundant data.\n",
    "2. **Chunk the document**: Implement and experiment with different chunking strategies (fixed-length, semantic-based, etc.).\n",
    "3. **Generate embeddings**: Use models like OpenAI's embedding model or **SentenceTransformers** from HuggingFace.\n",
    "4. **Store embeddings in ChromaDB**: The vector database will be used for efficient semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **_`Search Layer`_**\n",
    "The search layer enables efficient retrieval of relevant document chunks based on user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Design 3 test queries**: Identify common user queries that can be answered using the document.\n",
    "2. **Embed the queries**: Convert them into vector representations using the chosen embedding model.\n",
    "3. **Retrieve relevant chunks**: Use similarity search in ChromaDB to fetch the most relevant document sections.\n",
    "4. **Implement caching mechanism**: Optimize retrieval speed by caching frequently searched queries.\n",
    "5. **Re-ranking block**: Improve accuracy using cross-encoding models from HuggingFace to refine the top retrieved results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **_`Generation Layer`_**\n",
    "The generation layer is responsible for generating final answers based on the retrieved document chunks using a language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Design an effective prompt**: Create a structured prompt that ensures high-quality, context-aware responses.\n",
    "2. **Use a large language model (LLM)**: Experiment with different models like OpenAI's GPT or similar open-source models.\n",
    "3. **Incorporate few-shot examples**: Improve accuracy by providing sample queries and expected answers.\n",
    "4. **Generate final responses**: Combine retrieved information with LLM-generated outputs for precise answers.\n",
    "5. **Evaluate responses**: Assess accuracy and relevancy using the three test queries."

    "## <code>Read, Process PDF File</code>📄\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with PDF files and extract relevant data like text, tables, and other document elements, we'll use the **pdfplumber** library. This library provides powerful functionality for parsing and extracting data from PDF files, offering several key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Extraction:** Pdfplumber allows for the extraction of plain text from a PDF, including handling different layouts and encoding.\n",
    "- **Table Extraction:** It has built-in support for extracting tabular data from PDFs, which can be useful when you need to capture structured data from documents.\n",
    "- **Advanced Parsing:** Pdfplumber also supports parsing images and other document elements, and it comes with visual debugging features to help identify how the document is structured.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### ___`Installing pdfplumber`___\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install `pdfplumber` via pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "!pip install pdfplumber\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Example Workflow for Reading and Processing PDFs:`___\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of how you can use pdfplumber to read a PDF file, extract text, and also pull out tables from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pdfplumber\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the PDF file with pdfplumber\n",
    "with pdfplumber.open(\"path_to_pdf_file.pdf\") as pdf:\n",
    "    # Loop through all the pages in the PDF\n",
    "    for page in pdf.pages:\n",
    "        # Extract plain text from the page\n",
    "        text = page.extract_text()\n",
    "        print(\"Extracted Text:\")\n",
    "        print(text)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # Extract tables from the page\n",
    "        tables = page.extract_tables()\n",
    "        print(\"Extracted Tables:\")\n",
    "        for table in tables:\n",
    "            for row in table:\n",
    "                print(row)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Key Features:`___\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extracting Text:**\n",
    "  - The `extract_text()` method allows for extracting all the text from a specific page.\n",
    "  - If you need to extract text from the entire document, you can loop through all pages.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Extracting Tables:**\n",
    "  - The `extract_tables()` method helps extract tabular data.\n",
    "  - It returns a list of tables, where each table is represented as a list of rows, and each row is a list of cells.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Handling Complex PDFs:**\n",
    "  - Pdfplumber allows for more complex processing, like handling OCR (optical character recognition) for images and non-readable content, which can be valuable in PDFs that contain scanned pages or non-selectable text.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Visual Debugging:**\n",
    "  - Pdfplumber has useful debugging tools to visualize how the PDF is parsed, making it easier to understand the layout and structure of complex documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Why pdfplumber?`___\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision:** It ensures the preservation of layout and tables, unlike other libraries like PyPDF2, which focus mainly on text extraction.\n",
    "- **Advanced Extraction:** pdfplumber can handle PDFs with a mix of text, tables, and images, providing a comprehensive solution.\n",
    "- **Debugging:** The visual debugging tools make it easy to adjust parsing techniques when working with more complicated PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, pdfplumber is a highly efficient tool for reading and extracting data from PDF files, especially when dealing with documents that include structured elements like tables and non-text content. Whether you're parsing plain text or dealing with more complex layouts, pdfplumber is a versatile and powerful solution."

    "To implement document chunking and generate embeddings, we need to break down the text into smaller, more manageable pieces (chunks). This is particularly useful when dealing with large documents, as embeddings are typically generated for smaller units of text (chunks) rather than for the entire document at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <code>Document Chunking</code>📄\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward approach for chunking is to split the document's text into fixed-size chunks. Each chunk will contain a specific number of characters or words. Once the text is chunked, we can generate embeddings for each chunk and then use these embeddings for semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Steps:`___\n",
    "1. **Extract Text from PDF**: We first extract the text from the document using libraries like `pdfplumber`.\n",
    "2. **Chunk the Text**: Split the text into smaller parts (chunks), each with a predefined size (e.g., 500 characters or a set number of words).\n",
    "3. **Generate Embeddings**: Once the text is chunked, generate embeddings for each chunk using a model like `SentenceTransformer`.\n",
    "4. **Use Embeddings for Semantic Search**: These embeddings can now be used for semantic search to find relevant chunks based on a user's query."

    "2. **Chunk the Text**: Use the `chunk_text` function to split the extracted text.\n",

    "4. **Perform Semantic Search**: Use the embeddings to perform a semantic search based on a user's query."

    "### <code>Fixed-Size Chunking</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "In **fixed-size chunking**, we split a document into smaller, manageable chunks, where each chunk has a fixed size, either in terms of characters or words. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with large documents that need to be processed in smaller pieces to generate embeddings, perform semantic search, or further analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how **fixed-size chunking** works:\n",
    "- **Fixed Size**: You define the size of each chunk. This can be based on character count (e.g., 500 characters) or word count (e.g., 100 words).\n",
    "- **Sliding Window**: The text is divided into windows of the defined size. This means that each chunk will have a fixed number of characters or words, and the next chunk will start immediately after the previous one, without any overlap (unless specified).\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### ___`Advantages of Fixed-Size Chunking`___\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: This is a straightforward technique where the document is just split into pieces of equal size.\n",
    "- **Efficient**: It’s computationally efficient, especially when dealing with large documents.\n",
    "- **Memory Management**: Small chunks are easier to process in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Example: Fixed-Size Chunking`___\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s go through an example of splitting text into fixed-size chunks, where each chunk contains 500 characters:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function to chunk text into fixed-size chunks of specified size\n",
    "def chunk_text_fixed_size(text, chunk_size=500):\n",
    "    chunks = []\n",
    "    # Loop through the text and slice it into chunks of fixed size\n",
    "    for i in range(0, len(text), chunk_size):\n",
    "        chunks.append(text[i:i + chunk_size])\n",
    "    return chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example text from a PDF or document\n",
    "text = \"This is an example of a large document that we will split into smaller chunks of fixed size. \" \\\n",
    "       \"Each chunk will have a specified number of characters, making it easier to process.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Split the text into chunks of 100 characters each\n",
    "chunk_size = 100\n",
    "chunks = chunk_text_fixed_size(text, chunk_size)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the chunks\n",
    "for idx, chunk in enumerate(chunks):\n",
    "    print(f\"Chunk {idx+1}: {chunk}\\n\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Process Flow for Fixed-Size Chunking:`___\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract Text**:\n",
    "   - First, extract the text from the document (such as from a PDF).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Chunk the Text**:\n",
    "   - Split the text into fixed-size chunks using the `chunk_text_fixed_size()` function.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Generate Embeddings**:\n",
    "   - Use an embedding model like `SentenceTransformer` to generate embeddings for each chunk.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Semantic Search**:\n",
    "   - Use these embeddings for performing semantic search on the document. A user's query can be matched to the relevant chunk based on its embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Why Fixed-Size Chunking?`___\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy to Implement**: Fixed-size chunking is simple to implement and understand. You don’t need complex algorithms to break the text into chunks.\n",
    "- **No Overlap**: This method doesn’t overlap chunks, making it faster and more efficient for processing large documents.\n",
    "- **Useful for Simple Models**: Works well for basic semantic search tasks where you don’t need overlapping or context-aware chunking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Example Workflow with Embeddings`___\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract Text from PDF**: Use `pdfplumber` to extract text from the document.\n",
    "2. **Chunk Text**: Break the extracted text into fixed-size chunks.\n",
    "3. **Generate Embeddings**: Generate embeddings for each chunk using a model like `SentenceTransformer`.\n",
    "4. **Perform Search**: Use these embeddings for semantic search when a user queries the document."

    "In the context of semantic search, **embeddings** are vector representations of the text that capture its semantic meaning. By converting documents or chunks of text into embeddings, we can compare them effectively using mathematical operations like cosine similarity to identify relevant documents based on a user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _**`Encoding Pipeline`**_\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Encoding Pipeline** follows a structured process for transforming raw documents (or text) into embeddings. Here’s a step-by-step overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Documents**: These are the raw textual data you want to work with. This could be anything from articles, research papers, insurance policies, or any text-based content.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Text Embedder**: This step uses a pre-trained model (like `SentenceTransformer` or other deep learning-based models) to convert the raw text into embeddings. The text embedder is a neural network model that encodes each document or chunk of text into a dense vector space, where semantically similar texts are closer together in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Store Embeddings**: After embedding the documents, these vectors are stored in a database or vector store. The embeddings are used for subsequent tasks, such as similarity searches and ranking. By storing the embeddings, we can efficiently retrieve and compare them later when processing user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Steps for Generating Embeddings`___\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **1. Extract Text**\n",
    "The first step is to extract text from your documents, whether they are in PDFs, Word files, or plain text. This can be done using libraries like **pdfplumber** for PDFs or other parsers for different file types.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **2. Chunk the Text**\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, documents are usually chunked into smaller pieces (like paragraphs or fixed-size chunks) to make them easier to process and generate embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **3. Generate Embeddings**\n",
    "Use a model like **SentenceTransformer** to generate the embeddings for each chunk of text. These embeddings are the vectorized representations that capture the semantic meaning of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the model\n",
    "embedder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: List of document chunks\n",
    "chunks = [\"This is the first document.\", \"This is the second document.\", \"This is the third document.\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate embeddings for each chunk\n",
    "embeddings = embedder.encode(chunks)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(embeddings)  # This will print the embeddings for each chunk\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **4. Store the Embeddings**\n",
    "Once the embeddings are generated, they are stored in a database or vector store like **ChromaDB**, **FAISS**, or **Pinecone** for efficient similarity searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Example Workflow`___\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract text** from a PDF document using **pdfplumber** or another text extraction library.\n",
    "2. **Chunk the extracted text** into fixed-size chunks or semantic chunks.\n",
    "3. **Generate embeddings** for each chunk using a pre-trained model like **SentenceTransformer**.\n",
    "4. **Store embeddings** in a vector store to make them searchable.\n",
    "5. **Semantic search**: When a user query is received, generate an embedding for the query and compare it with the stored embeddings to retrieve the most relevant documents."

    "## <code>Re-Ranking with a Cross Encoder</code>📄\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-ranking the results obtained from a semantic search helps improve the relevance of the retrieved results by scoring the relationship between the query and the returned documents. **Cross-Encoders** are typically used to fine-tune and rank the responses more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _**`Bi-Encoder vs. Cross-Encoder`**_\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bi-Encoder**:\n",
    "  - The Bi-Encoder model processes both the query and the document separately and generates embeddings for each. The embeddings for the query and document are then compared using cosine similarity (or another similarity metric) to assess relevance.\n",
    "  - The query and document are encoded independently, making the process faster, especially when working with a large number of documents. However, it might not capture deeper interactions between the query and document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-Encoder**:\n",
    "  - In a Cross-Encoder model, the query and document are processed together, allowing the model to directly score the relevance of the document with respect to the query.\n",
    "  - The Cross-Encoder typically uses a model like BERT, where both the query and document are concatenated and passed together through the model to output a relevance score.\n",
    "  - This method is computationally more expensive but can produce more accurate relevance scores since the model can capture the interactions between the query and document in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _**`How Cross-Encoder Works:`**_\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input**: A query is paired with a document (or a chunk of text).\n",
    "2. **Model**: The Cross-Encoder (typically based on a model like BERT) processes both the query and the document simultaneously.\n",
    "3. **Output**: The model produces a relevance score between 0 and 1, indicating how relevant the document is to the query.\n",
    "4. **Re-ranking**: The results are sorted based on these relevance scores, improving the quality of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Example Use Case`___\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s say we have a set of documents retrieved via a semantic search, and we want to re-rank these results based on how well they answer the user’s query. We can use a Cross-Encoder to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pass each query-document pair**: We take the user query and each document from the search results.\n",
    "2. **Generate relevance scores**: The Cross-Encoder will generate a score for each query-document pair.\n",
    "3. **Rank the documents**: Sort the documents based on these scores to bring the most relevant results to the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Workflow for Re-Ranking`___\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perform Initial Semantic Search**: Use a **Bi-Encoder** or another semantic search technique to retrieve relevant documents or chunks of text based on the query.\n",
    "2. **Cross-Encoder Re-Ranking**: Pass the query and retrieved document pairs into the **Cross-Encoder** to generate relevance scores for each pair.\n",
    "3. **Re-Rank and Display**: Sort the results based on the scores and present the most relevant documents first.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Cross-Encoder Diagram:`___\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bi-Encoder**: Both the query and document are encoded independently, and their embeddings are compared via cosine similarity.\n",
    "- **Cross-Encoder**: The query and document are passed together through a classifier to produce a relevance score.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to implement the Cross-Encoder re-ranking, we can use pre-trained models like **`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`** or another BERT-based model, and use it to re-rank the search results based on relevance."

    "## <code>Retrieval Augmented Generation</code>📄\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that enhances the response generation process by combining the power of information retrieval (searching for relevant documents) and generation (using models like GPT-3 to produce a coherent response). In RAG, we first retrieve relevant documents or chunks using a semantic search, then pass these documents (along with the user's query) to a language model like GPT to generate a final, well-structured answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _**`How RAG Works:`**_\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieve Top Documents**:\n",
    "   - Initially, we perform a **semantic search** (or a **cross-encoder re-ranking**) to find the most relevant documents or text chunks for the user’s query.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Generate Answer**:\n",
    "   - The retrieved documents (typically the top results) are passed to a **language model** like **GPT-3** or **GPT-3.5** alongside the query.\n",
    "   - The model then generates a **direct answer** to the query based on the retrieved information.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Citations**:\n",
    "   - Instead of returning the entire document or chunk, the model generates a concise answer and provides **citations** that point to the relevant sections of the document, making the answer more trustworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Output**:\n",
    "   - The final output is a **generated response** that directly answers the query, references the relevant documents or sections, and avoids overwhelming the user with unnecessary information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **_`Steps Involved in RAG:`_**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Query**: A query is submitted by the user.\n",
    "2. **Document Retrieval**: Retrieve the most relevant documents using a **semantic search** (e.g., Bi-Encoder or Cross-Encoder).\n",
    "3. **Generate Answer**: Pass the query and retrieved documents to a **language model (e.g., GPT-3.5)** with a well-crafted prompt.\n",
    "4. **Return Response**: The model generates an answer based on the retrieved documents, citing them as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **_`Example of Retrieval-Augmented Generation`_**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how we can use **GPT-3.5** for RAG, passing the query along with the top 3 documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import openai\n",
    "\n",
    "def generate_response(query, results_df):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Generate a response using GPT-3.5's ChatCompletion based on the user query and retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters:\n",
    "    query (str): The user's query.\n",
    "    results_df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing the top search results (documents and metadata).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "    list: A list of strings with the response from GPT-3.5.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    # Prepare the system and user messages for GPT-3.5\n",
    "    documents = results_df['Documents'].tolist()\n",
    "    top_3_RAG = \"\\n\".join([f\"Document {i+1}: {doc}\" for i, doc in enumerate(documents)])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Prepare the prompt for GPT\n",
    "    prompt = f\"\"\"\n",
    "    You are a helpful assistant who answers queries related to insurance policies.\n",

    "    Top 3 relevant documents retrieved:\n",
    "    {top_3_RAG}\n",
    "\n",
    "    Please answer the query based on the documents above. Be concise, informative, and provide citations for your answer using the document numbers (1, 2, 3).\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Make the API call to GPT-3.5\n",
    "    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n",

    "df = get_topn(3, df)\n",
    "response = generate_response(query, df)\n",
    "print(\"\\n\".join(response))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Key Components:`___\n",
    "- **Query**: The user’s question.\n",
    "- **Top Documents**: The relevant documents retrieved from the search process, typically the top 3.\n",
    "- **GPT-3.5 Model**: The language model that processes the query and documents to generate a coherent and accurate answer.\n",
    "- **Citations**: The response includes references to the original documents (like \"Document 1\", \"Document 2\") to support the generated answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Benefits of Retrieval-Augmented Generation:`___\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Concise Responses**: RAG allows you to generate concise, accurate responses without overwhelming the user with entire documents.\n",
    "2. **Accurate Citations**: By providing citations, you ensure that the answers are backed by the relevant sections of the document, improving trustworthiness.\n",
    "3. **Better Relevance**: By leveraging semantic search and re-ranking, the model can generate more relevant answers by focusing only on the parts of the documents that matter most to the query.\n",
    "4. **Improved Efficiency**: Instead of processing entire documents, you only work with the relevant portions, improving both speed and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ___`Next Steps:`___\n",
    "- Implement the semantic search, cross-encoder re-ranking, and GPT-3.5 response generation as shown above.\n",
    "- Fine-tune the prompt for even better results (e.g., adjusting the tone or structure of the answer).\n",
    "- Store responses and citations efficiently to allow for rapid retrieval in future queries."

    "### <code>Conclusion:</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code outlines an end-to-end process for handling user queries in the context of insurance policy documents, leveraging a combination of search, semantic reranking, and response generation using AI models. Here's a detailed breakdown of the flow and how each component contributes to the final solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Searching for Relevant Documents:**\n",
    "   - The `search()` function plays a crucial role in first querying the cache collection to quickly return results. If no relevant data is found in the cache or if the cached results don't meet a predefined threshold, it queries the main collection of insurance documents.\n",
    "   - The function then adds the retrieved documents back into the cache for faster future searches, ensuring that the system gets more efficient over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Re-ranking with Cross-Encoder:**\n",
    "   - After retrieving documents, the `apply_cross_encoder()` function takes the user query and applies a semantic model (CrossEncoder) to rerank the documents based on their relevance to the query.\n",
    "   - This function helps improve the quality of the results by assigning relevance scores to documents based on the specific query, ensuring that the most contextually relevant results are prioritized.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Selecting Top Documents:**\n",
    "   - The `get_topn()` function selects the top N documents based on the reranked scores, ensuring that the user receives the most relevant information in response to their query.\n",
    "   - In this case, the top 3 documents are selected, which balance between providing enough relevant information while keeping the response concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generating a Response:**\n",
    "   - The `generate_response()` function uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate a human-readable answer to the query, incorporating the top documents and their metadata (such as policy names and page numbers).\n",
    "   - The system takes into account relevant content from the documents, reformatting tables if necessary, and providing citations to ensure the response is accurate and well-supported by the source material.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handling Dynamic Queries:**\n",
    "   - The system is designed to handle various types of insurance-related queries dynamically. For example, queries like \"What is the life insurance coverage for disability?\" or \"What is the condition of death while not wearing a seat belt?\" are processed, and the system fetches relevant documents from the database, ranks them, and generates a response.\n",
    "   - The use of semantic search and reranking makes it robust for understanding complex queries, ensuring that users get precise and actionable information.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cache System for Efficiency:**\n",
    "   - The integration of a caching mechanism enhances the overall efficiency. Frequently asked queries are stored in the cache, ensuring that subsequent queries can be answered much faster. This is important for improving system performance and reducing the load on the database for repetitive queries."

    "### <code>Benefits:</code>\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** By querying the cache first, the system saves time when responding to previously asked queries. It also ensures that only relevant documents are considered for reranking, reducing unnecessary computations.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** As the number of documents and queries grows, the system can scale by effectively leveraging the cache and dynamically reranking the documents based on relevance scores.\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** The use of a powerful language model (like OpenAI's GPT) ensures that the responses generated are not only accurate but also contextually relevant. The system is able to understand complex queries and provide human-like, insightful responses.\n",
    "- **User-Centric:** The system is designed to focus on delivering answers that directly address the user's needs, avoiding unnecessary internal details and improving the overall user experience."
